This repository contains stuff I made while playing around with procedural
generation.  Stuff I'm planning on doing:

* Generate heightmap, normal map, map texture for random world
* Add vegitation to map
* Place villages on map (figure out a good way to do this based on elevation)
* Work on villiage zoning (residential, industrial, etc).  Each building should have a purpose.
* Add "resources" to map, villiagers collect them based on need
* Add farming
* Add roads between villiages, merchants that travel them
* Add wildlife generator (wildlife based on biome)
* Generate bridges, etc
* Move heightmap to a planet generator

Crazy ideas:
* Add fancy gfx (global illumination, god rays based on sun, mist, etc)
* Send basic mesh to GPU, transform it based on camera location and seed?  Might be faster maybe!
* Make realistic economy based on a free market.  Have villiagers mine and farm the resources they need as a collective at first, and start introducing more and more selfishness into the system.
* Villiagers can use resources to build more buildings, bridges, increasingly complex tech, etc
* Add crime && military police
* Add wars
