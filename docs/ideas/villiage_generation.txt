Observations about RL villiages:

* Ground should be relatively flat
* Be near water source
* Be near resources
* Exist in regions with hospitable temperatures

Ideas:

1.) Decide on size of villiage (say, 10 buildings).
2.) Find areas that can support buildings in close proximity, public spots, etc
3.) Form land to fit the villiage (flatten land for houses, build paths, etc)
4.) Spawn buildings
